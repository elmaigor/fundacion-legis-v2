    <h2>Prison Assistance Project (PAP)</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      We sow hope and care for the future by defending rights and offering guidance throughout
      the process of serving a prison sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more than ten years, one of our founding partners, <strong>Vox Legis</strong>, has been
      providing <em>pro bono</em> assistance in the prison system, accompanying and advising
      numerous people in vulnerable situations and their families.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>1. New Admissions</h3>
    <p>
      When uncertainty turns into hope, we answer all your questions.  
      We know that entering prison can generate fear, confusion and insecurity.
      That’s why, together with Vox Legis, we offer specialized accompaniment,
      combining legal advice and human support from the very beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since information is the first step to freedom, the guide designed by Vox Legis is a
      free tool we provide to beneficiaries — a clear manual answering the most frequent
      questions and fostering confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are not yet a beneficiary but would like to obtain the manual, you can request it through this link:

    <h3>2. Legal Advice and Prison Defense Services</h3>
    <p>
      Human dignity and fundamental rights are often at risk in a situation of deprivation of liberty.
      Aware of the inequalities and lack of information that characterize the prison world, we aim to
      contribute by offering close, humane and high-quality assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We accompany beneficiaries through all stages of imprisonment: providing legal advice and, when necessary,
      offering defense before administrative or judicial authorities.
      Whether the case involves permits, classifications, sanctions, prison work, sentence accumulation,
      security measures or other benefits — we are here to protect rights.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>3. Family Support</h3>
    <p>
      We accompany those who support you from outside — they deserve it.  
      Prison not only affects those serving a sentence but also those waiting beyond its walls.
      Families carry uncertainty, fear and lack of information, becoming the silent victims of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Fundación Legis, we believe that supporting families is also an act of justice.
      We provide legal and emotional guidance to families of inmates, helping with communication,
      clarifying procedures, and offering orientation regarding permits, visits or reintegration programs.
    </p>
